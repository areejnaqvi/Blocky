# Blocky

Blocky was our final project for CSC148. 

The code behind the functioning of the game is produced by me and my group member, Fizzah Rehman (@fzzhman)

Types of Players:
1. A human player - 
2. A random player - a computer player that chooses moves randomly
3. A smart player - a computer player that chooses moves smartly

Goals:
1. Blob goal: The player must aim for the largest “blob” of a given colour c (the target colour). A blob is a group of connected blocks with the same colour. Two blocks are connected if their sides touch; touching corners doesn’t count. The player’s score is the number of unit cells in the largest blob of the target colour.
2. Perimeter goal: The player must aim to put the most possible units of a given colour c (the target colour) on the outer perimeter of the board. The player’s score is the total number of unit cells of the target colour that are on the perimeter. There is a premium on corner cells: they count twice towards the score.
